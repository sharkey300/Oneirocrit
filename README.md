# Oneirocrit
## Demo
If you'd like to demo this program before downloading, you can find a live demo [here](https://sharkey300.github.io/Oneirocrit/). This demo does not allow importing shows or viewing transcripts. Do note that this demo is running on the free version of Microsoft Azure so it may be slow at times.
## Guide
This is a program that analyzes show transcripts from [forever dreaming](https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/). To run this, you must be using Windows and have Python installed on your computer. If you do not have Python, you can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have Python and you have downloaded the [latest release](https://github.com/sharkey300/Oneirocrit/releases), find `setup.bat` and run it. This will download and install all the Python libraries necessary to run the program. Once that's complete, run `start.bat`. This will start up the server and open the program in your browser. Once you're done, you can close the console to shut down the server. This program runs offline, however you will need an internet connection to import new shows.
